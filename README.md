# Transfer-learning-with-TrAdaBoost
Scikit-learn style implementation of TrAdaBoost algorithm

Implementation of TrAdaBoost algorithm from ICML'07 paper "Boosting for Transfer Learning" by Dai et al. This version is compatible with scikit-learn interface and can be used in cross-validation as well as Grid search.
